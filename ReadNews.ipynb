They are both here to talk to you about the need to focus on the triple emergencies of climate, biodiversity and pollution, as outlined in UNEP's latest report, \"Making Peace with Nature: A scientific blueprint to tackle the climate, biodiversity and pollution emergencies.\" [...] The first is the presentation of Nationally Determined Contributions, Nationally Determined Contributions that will present the immediate action of the United States and the measures in the horizon of 2030, and we hope that they will translate into a very meaningful reduction of emissions and that they will be an example for other countries to follow. [...] Secretary-General: There was no contribution from the US Government, but I think it's important to say that, when one looks at the American society ‑‑ and today, governments have much less power than in the past ‑‑ we have seen a fantastic mobilisation of the private sector, of the cities, of some states, of the civil society as a whole, and that has allowed the situation that we have today in which the US is still on time to be fully on track for the net zero in 2050 and for being part of the global effort to keep the temperatures below 1.5 degrees of growth in the end of the century. [...] We are not too late, but we need to make sure that we are able, not only to create the conditions for a drastic reduction of emissions in the horizon of the next decade, making it possible to achieve the limit of 1.5 degrees, this is the year where we need to have a new framework to preserve biodiversity, and this is the year where we need to take a number of very important measures to reduce pollution.\n",

In the last two weeks, several witnesses have spotted and filmed a large, black feline prowling around the province of Bari , near the towns of Castellana Grotte and Acquaviva delle Fonti. [...] On Monday veterinarians and experts, called to analyse videos, photos and organic traces, confirmed the animal was a black panther. It is not yet clear where it came from or where it has fled to.

      " KRRS leader Chukki Nanjundaswamy In the first phase, these conventions will begin from Shivamogga on March 20 In a bid to lend momentum in Karnataka to farmers’ struggle against the Centre’s new farm laws, all factions of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) are set to come together to hold farmers’ conventions in different places from March 20. Announcing this at a press conference here on Friday, KRRS leader Chukki Nanjundaswamy said the KRRS and the Hasiru Sene would organise district-level farmers’ conventions in several places starting from Shivamogga on March 20 in the first phase. [...] Expressing concern over urban consumers’ indifference to the three laws as well as farmers’ protests, she said the laws would actually impact food security which would affect consumers. These laws will make us lose our rights on food as corporates will start controlling our food choices,” Ms. Nanjundaswamy said. The conventions would be held in Haveri on March 21 and Belagavi on March 22, she said.\n",

However, in India, the number of workers who may need to make job transitions is likely to remain stable.“In India, the number of workers who may need to make job transitions by 2030 is likely to remain stable after Covid-19 , compared to before the pandemic. This is in large part because the main trend determining how many workers may need to change occupations is the continuing migration of workers from the agriculture sector to the manufacturing and service sectors. [...] The trend is disrupting jobs in the travel and leisure arenas and is hastening the decline of low-wage jobs in brick and mortar stores and restaurants to jobs in distribution centres and last-mile delivery.According to the India findings of the report, customer and food service may see fewer jobs due to trends accelerated by Covid-19, driving fewer transitions out of agriculture.\n",

      " As hundreds of thousands of Indian farmers charge ahead with their monthslong protests of new agricultural laws on the outskirts of New Delhi, the movement has spilled over to the internet. Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh described the situation to talk show host Lilly Singh on Tuesday, “farmers are just asking for their rights. By asking for their rights they’re being labelled as terrorists. They’re being considered disloyal to the country. There is a very violent and suppressive and oppressive climate created by the Indian state and by the police.” [...] Tensions escalated on Jan. 26 in a violent clash between farmers and police that left one protester dead and hundreds injured. [...] Police have erected concrete barriers and barbed wire and planted spikes around the capital city to prevent farmers from entering. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has intermittently cut off internet and phone service to the farmers’ camps to suppress protests — a move condemned by internet rights groups.\n",

The Bozeman boom has fueled an “incredible increase” in the local homeless population, as well as a spate of pop-up RV communities for those who’ve been displaced, according to Grenier. [...] HRDC, which provides an array of social services from housing to programs for seniors, has seen nearly 1,000 new customers this year, a 7% increase. [...] Competition for housing in small towns an hour or more away, often between Bozeman residents who need to relocate to cheaper housing, has led to similar price increases, according to Matsen.
